Introduction:
Students will apply to universities, and each university will have its own manner of admitting students, such as through entrance tests or direct admission. With previously gathered student information, such as admission exam score, CGPA, and other characteristics, it is possible to determine and predict if a student has any possibility of getting admitted.

Prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian Perspective:
Based on the variations in each aspect, we can predict the admission chances for a certain student using the provided student information. A college accepts applications based on a variety of factors. As a result, we may acquire the results by employing the classification technique. In our model Classification has two results: true (1) or false (0), and the generated value is correct with any of these possibilities. It is determined by the type of classifiers or algorithms used.
